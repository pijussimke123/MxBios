Welcome to the MxBios project!  This project implements an X86 legacy
bios that is built with standard GNU tools.

For the impatient, MxBios is built for QEMU and tested on QEMU with:

  make
  qemu -bios out/bios.bin

MxBios can be configured with kconfig.  To change the default
configuration one can run "make menuconfig" prior to running "make".

For other types of builds, and for more detailed developer
documentation, please see the online documentation listed above.
